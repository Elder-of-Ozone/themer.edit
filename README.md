edited version of https://github.com/coleifer 's themer

Thank you coleifer for letting use use your code for the base;
Thanks jimble from #rice for helping with the symbolic linking;


#this will serve as a guide for how to use themer.edit


Current functionality: when supplied with an image, it creates a i3.conf, colors.yaml, html file to display example of colors, and an xresources file.   you can use 
##./themer.py activate theme_name
to change to another theme.

#MAKE SURE you symbollically link your main .config/i3/config to the .config/themer/current/i3.conf inorder for it to work properly


#(eventual) to do list:
generate themes for other tiling WMs(if possible?)
generate themes for text editors (sublime, emacs, vim)
generate themes for panels (tint2, i3status, pystatus)
generate themes for dmenu and it's alternatives
generate themes for irc clients
generate stylish firefox css based off twily's(?)
generate colorschemes for different terminals (termite, lilyterm, etc)
generate color schemes for other popular apps( suggestions?)

make it simpler

make it work for a wide variety of systems

make it easier for new users to tinker with their themes after making it
